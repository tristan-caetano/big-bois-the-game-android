# Big Bois The Game for Android Info

## What is this project?
This is a game that I created while I was learning Java in college. It originaly started in an eclipse terminal, then I created a desktop GUI for it, and now it's finally an Android game. This game was essentially a way I could use skills I was learning and apply them to my own project so I wasn't only using my knowledge of coding for my homework. I've really found that this game has absolutely improved my skill of Java, and even made me teach myself about Android development.

## What is the purpose of this repo?
Just a way to document and organize this project. I do anticipate on having more projects and having them all accessible from here.

## Why the title "Big Bois The Game"?
The project originally started as a joke, and the language in the original game was much more vulgar, however this project quickly turned into more than just a joke. The title was probably the first thing that came to mind when trying to figure out a title.

## Will there be a version available for iPhone?
As of writing this, I currently do not know Swift, although I would definitely love to learn it in the future as soon as XCode comes to the iPad. However, I don't know if I would stick with Big Bois or move onto another project to teach myself Swift.

## Will Big Bois The Game recieve more updates and fully compiled APKs?
I am not completely sure. I would like to move over to more projects as I continue to learn more languages. Big Bois The Game is by far my largest project, however I would like to have more projects to work on. I usually take large breaks in between working on Big Bois The Game as there really isn't much in it for me other than the learning experience. (It took me 3 attempts before actually successfully figuring out Android development) Finally, I still don't take Big Bois The Game very seriously, I work on it when I feel a burst of motivation, and then I might stop for a few months. It isn't a passion project, just a little game to teach myself new things.

## Why Java?
It was the first coding language I was properly taught. I did know a bit of VBA, but I did not want to write a whole game in Excel.

## What IDEs or Text Editors do you use?
For this project specifically I started with Eclipse, I eventually moved over to IntelliJ IDEA as I preferred the interface to Eclipse. Then, for the Android version I used Android Studio.

## What is your next project?
I genuinley have no idea. I enjoy coding and I would like to think that I will work on many personal projects, it really depends on how I feel.

## How do I play the game?
You should be able to download it onto any android device, I personally tested it on a Razer Phone 2 and a Pixel 4 XL. You can then select the APK in the downloads folder and install the game, then you can play the game as if you downloaded it from the play store. I have also tested the game on an Oculus Quest 2, although I wouldn't reccommend it because the formatting is weird for it, unless its the only Android device you have and you really want to play this game for some reason. 

## Is there a full update log for the game?
Not for the android version, the update log for the android version currently only has its comparisons to the desktop version. However, the desktop version does have a full update log. The android version was made to copy almost all of the functions that are in the desktop version, except for the outlined differences, so I felt that an update log that just reiterates everything that is added feels a bit redundant.
